## Mo's website is finally here

As Mo would expect, someone has finally created a website that is all. about. him. Shame it's ten years later than it should have been. It's lucky he's a patient rabbit.

### Mo's needs
Mo does not like to eat most things. He will refuse even the best quality produce, if it doesn't fit his standards. These are some things he won't eat:

```markdown
Vegetables

- Carrots (weird, right?)
- Spinach
- Anything else you can think of.

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/charlottesca/I-made-a-website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
